One of the issues that face planners, regulators and communities is that FVAs, by their nature, are based on predictions and estimates that are highly subjective. One surveyor can have an honest disagreement with another about what the real value of something is, the timing of valuations is also a factor, and this means that there is often no right or wrong answer when it comes to determining financial viability. 

But where do those shades of grey fade to back. Where does the space for genuine, honestly held disagreement about the viability of a scheme end, and fraud begin? 

The answer to that must be about intent. What was the intention of the surveyor when they created their FVA? Was it to produce a genuine and honest assessment of the viability position of the scheme? or a misleading one? 

Clearly making a judgement on behaviour is a difficult task. How can we know what the intent of a surveyor was? obviously, if there intent was to undermine their profession, then that is something they are unlikely to freely admit to. 

This is why professional guidance is important, to provide a consistency of approach. It is also why looking at a range of cases is helpful. If a surveyor is consistently disregarding professional guidance, and in doing so is consistently providing their clients with an unjustified benefit that comes at the public expense, then it is difficult to come any other conclusion than that which says that a surveyor is facilitating a fraud. That of course is a very serious breech of the requirements of the profession. 

This paper has demonstrated a number of examples where surveyors appear to have manipulated FVAs in order to provide the appearance that a development is unviable when in fact it is not.  Often to achieve this goal, the FVAs often disregard established guidance on how to conduct an FVA. 

In many of these cases these manipulations should have been addressed by the planning authority or their consultants. Whether they were or were not is immaterial. The surveyors putting together the FVAs are under a professional duty to make their best efforts to provide an accurate and fair representation of scheme viability, whether or not they have another surveyor or authority breathing down their neck. The existence of an independent check of their work is a safeguard, it does not relieve them of their obligations because safeguards can sometime fail. 

It is now up to RICS to provide an appropriate remedy.
