The issue that faces planners, regulators and communities is that FVAs, by their nature, are based on predictions and estimates that are highly subjective. One surveyor can have an honest disagreement with another about what the real value of something is, the timing of valuations is also a factor, and this means that there is often no right or wrong answer when it comes to determining financial viability. 

But where do those shades of grey fade to back. Where does the space for genuine, honestly held disagreement about the viability of a scheme end, and fraud begin? 

The answer to that must be about intent. What was the intention of the surveyor when they created their FVA? Was it to produce a genuine and honest assessment of the viability position of the scheme? or a misleading one?
