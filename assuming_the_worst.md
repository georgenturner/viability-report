# Assuming the worst

Most of the estimates in a financial viability assessment will be based on estimates of values and costs not yet realised. 

These estimates, like every estimate, could of course differ from the real amount of money actually paid or received, although we would expect professional surveyors exercising sound judgement to be relatively accurate in their estimations. 

However, occasionally some of the real costs or values in a development proposal will be known before a scheme gains planning permission. 

You may think that if the real inputs into a financial viability appraisal are known before a planning application is made, then there will be less opportunity for the developers to game the FVA. 

Think again! Why should an FVA use those real values, when an assumed value may produced a more favourable outcome for the developer?

##Heygate

The Heygate was a Southwark Council owned estate in the Elephant and Castle. In 2010 the council signed a development agreement with Lend Lease to demolish all 1,200 homes on the site and rebuild the estatate to a higher density and with more homes. 

Over 1,000 council tenants were moved off the Heygate, but lend lease claimed that it would only be viable to replace 83 homes on the new estate at social rents. A viabiliy assessment was produced by Lend Lease to support their claim. Savills were the consultant employed by Lend Lease to provide many the valuations for the FVA. 

That viability appraisal was later obtained by Adrian Glasspool, one of the former Heygate Residents after a two year battle where he ended up taking Southwark to court to compel them to release the document. 

###Compulsory purchase

In order move forward with the scheme, the council needed to buy out some residents from their leases. In all there were around 200 leaseholders on the Heygate. 

As it was part of a large regeneration project the leaseholders became the subject of a compulsory purchase order. 

Clearly the cost of buying the properties off existing residents was a cost of the development project that the scheme would have to bare. An allowance for the amount spent on buying leaseholders out of their leases was therefore part of the FVA. 

In this case the developers knew what this cost would be in many of the cases before the planning application was made. The council had been planning the regenration of the estate for a long time and had started buying property on the estate in 2004. 

However, when the developer submitted their FVA, they did not base their allowance for the cost of buying the leasholders flats on the real amounts that had been paid, but instead used an 'assumed' valuation which was substantially higher. 

According to freedom of information of requests the average amount paid to leaseholders at the Heygate was as follows: 

* 1 Bed flat - £95,480
* 2 Bed flat - £107,230
* 3 Bed Maisonette - £156,833 
* 4 Bed Maisonette - £177,421

However, Savills assumed values in the FVA stated the following amounts:

As is clear, the values assumed by Savills were in most cases around £100,000 per unit higher than the real amounts paid. This has the effect of artificially supressing the viability of the scheme, as the costs in the scheme would be larger than the acutal costs of the development. 

What is particularly galling about this case is that the council insisted that prices being offered were in line with market rates, and fought leaseholders who thought they should have been offered more. 

However, when it came to determining the viability of building new affordable homes the developer was insisting that the market rates were much higer. 

Whichever valuation was the correct one, someone was getting screwed.
