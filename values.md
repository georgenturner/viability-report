#Residental sales values
Underestimating the sales values of new apartments on the development is one of the simplest ways of manipulating a FVA. A lower valuation will mean lower profits and a less viable building.

To achieve this outcome, the evidence shows that when acting on behalf of a client, the surveyor will produce two separate valuations for the residential units on a new development. A lower valuation is used as an input into FVA and makes the proposal look less viable. 

A second valuation is used to sell the scheme to investors and shows a more realistic picture of scheme viability. The existence of the second valuation demonstrates that he valuation produced for the investor presentation was not an honest valuation on the part of the surveyor, but was created for the sole purpose of making the scheme look less viable. 

Of course, surveyors never reveal the fact that they have produced a range of valuations. This practice has only been uncovered by leaks of information passed to campaigners by people within the industry concerned about the practice. 

When it has been uncovered the defence of the industry has been that the valuations are not comparable. Financial viability assessments are based on current day valuations, or the prices on the day of the assessment, where as the data provided to investors is based on future estimates of prices. 

As will become clear from the evidence and case studies we will explore, that explanation is scarcely credible. 

However, even if it were true, then this form of double accounting still falls foul of the RICS professional guidance. 

The RICS guidance throughout consistently emphasises the need to exercise professional judgement. It says that figures may need to be updated to reflect changing market conditions. It stresses the importance of sensitivity testing to arrive at this judgement. The guidance note in the executive summary states: 

>“It is strongly recommended that financial appraisals are sensitivity tested as a minimum, and with more complex schemes further scenario/simulation analysis should also be undertaken. This is to ensure that a sound judgement can be formulated on viability.”

The guidance also states that it will be appropriate in complex schemes to model future sales growth to arrive at a more accurate judgement. 

The guidance also stresses the importance of transparency and the developer engaging in an open and honest conversation with the local authority. Indeed this need for transparency is often cited as the source of the requirement for confidentiality between the planning authority and the developer. It is argued that the amount of disclosure about the scheme given to the planning authority and their consultants can only be achieved if further disclosure to the outside world is protected. Again the guidance says:

>In order to encourage openness and transparency in the viability process both at pre and post application, it is also often the case that the viability reports submitted to a local planning authority are required to be classified as confidential in part or as a whole. This is to encourage the applicant to disclose the maximum amount of information, which can then be reviewed and reported upon.[^1]

It is difficult to understand how producing a second valuation of future prices, and keeping the existence of that valuation secret from the planning authority is in line with that guidance. 

The second valuation is clearly very relevant information for the authority. If surveyors were acting in line with the guidance then they should be open with the authority about alternative figures they may be producing. 

However, in the case studies below they were not. 

At no point was the existence of the alternative valuations, or the basis of those valuations voluntarily disclosed.
