Therefore in appearing to manipulate valuations for the benefit of their client and in order to get a local authority to drop their affordable housing requirement, it appears to me that Knight Frank, Savills and Quod were clearly acting against the public interest, and bringing the profession into disrepute. In addition, the way in which this was done, with the surveyors insisting on confidentiality, and not revealing the fact that they had produced two valuations brings also risks bringing the profession into disrepute. When a surveyor produces two contemporaneous valuations, and keeps the fact that they have done so secret in these circumstances it will obviously lead to the suspicion that the surveyor has engineered one valuation to help their client reduce the amount of affordable housing on the site. This is a point that has been acknowledged in a number of articles in the press which have called into the question of how development viability appraisals are conducted for affordable housing purposes.
