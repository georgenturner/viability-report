#8 Albert Embankment 

A very similar issue occurred at 8 Albert Embankment. 

8 Albert Embankment is the former headquarters of the London Fire Brigade. In 2011 plans to build new luxury housing on the site went to a public inquiry.
 
The developer's surveyors, Knight Frank, had produced a financial viability report that demonstrated that the development would not generate any land payment for the landowner. This was done on the premise that the existing use value was 0. In other words the FVA said that even after getting the land for free, the developer would not make enough profit in order to attract finance for the deal or pay for the land. This assessment was the basis of the developers request for the council to reduce the requirement to build affordable housing, which they acceded to. 

However, in secret, the Fire Authority had agreed a £40m up front payment for the land if the scheme were granted planning permission. Again this was only revealed after campaigners managed to obtain confidential documentation from the Fire Authority. 

Given that the Knight Frank's own financial viability report claimed that the development would be unviable for the developer, even if they got the land for free, agreeing to pay £40m upfront for the land was a bold move.

The answer as to why they would take such a risk is in the same investor's presentation produced for the Shell Centre. This presentation also listed expected sales values on nearby buildings, including 8 Albert Embankment (which was listed as Florian House). The Shell Centre investor presentation was produced in the same month as the public inquiry into 8 Albert Embankment.

The values for 8 Albert Embankment listed in the Shell investor presentation were 30% higher than those listed in the FVA. The values in the Shell Centre presentation were also clearly much more realistic given the obligation that the developer had to pay the land owner. At the higher values the land payment could be achieved, but had the land payment and the real valuation been known there would have been no argument to reduce the requirement to build affordable housing.

Although I could not know about the second valuation at the time I did raise the issue at the public inquiry. I thought that it was madness for the developer to be proceeding with a scheme that was economically so bad, when there was an obligation to make a large upfront land payment. I believed that the only explanation for this was that the developer had a second, higher valuation for the scheme. However, when I put this to Sue Cocking of Knight Frank at the public inquiry she told the inspector that she was not aware of any other valuation having been provided. However, it is impossible to believe that nobody at Knight Frank was aware that the company was producing more than one valuation.

Again I do not believe on the evidence that Knight Frank could have though that their valuation provided for the FVA for affordable housing purposes was accurate.
