#8 Albert Embankment 

A very similar issue occurred at 8 Albert Embankment. 

8 Albert Embankment is the former headquarters of the London Fire Brigade. In 2011 plans to build new luxury housing on the site went to a public inquiry.
 
The developer's surveyors, Knight Frank, had produced a financial viability report that demonstrated that the development would not generate any land payment for the landowner. This was done on the premise that the existing use value was 0. In other words the FVA said that even after getting the land for free, the developer would not make enough profit in order to attract finance for the deal or pay for the land. This assessment was the basis of the developers request for the council to reduce the requirement to build affordable housing, which they acceded to. 

However, in secret, the Fire Authority had agreed a £40m up front payment for the land if the scheme were granted planning permission. Again this was only revealed after campaigners managed to obtain confidential documentation from the Fire Authority.

As discussed earlier, the real land value is never used as a benchmark in an FVA. However, if the FVA is showing that the developemnt will not make enough money to make any land payment, and at the same time the developer has agreed to pay £40m for the land, then there must be something very wrong with the FVA. To proceed with the development on the basis of the FVA submitted to the council could only be described as insanity.

Though the Freedom of Information Act we found that the developer had written to Sue Foster at Lambeth Council to tell her that the valuations submitted to the council in the viability assessment did not represent the ‘true’ viability position of the scheme. Sue Foster, never asked the developer what the 'true' position was, and Lambeth’s surveyors, BNP Paribas, agreed with the untrue valuations and the community was forced to fight for affordable housing alone.

Later we would find the 'true' valuation in the investors presentation for the Shell Centre. This presentation, which was produced in the same month as the public inquiry into the 8 Albert Embankment scheme listed expected sales values on nearby buildings, including 8 Albert Embankment (which was listed as Florian House).

The values for 8 Albert Embankment listed in the Shell investor presentation were 30% higher than those listed in the FVA. At the higher values the development started to make financial sense. The higher sales values would generate profit which would allow the land payment to be achieved. 

However, had the land payment and the real valuation been known there would have been no argument to reduce the requirement to build affordable housing.

The Shell Investors presenation was not the only evidence that the developers in this case knew more than they were letting on to the council. The total development value of the site in the FVA was around £170m. However, on Native Land's own website the gross development value was listed as £230m.

Although I could not know about the second valuation at the time I did raise the issue at the public inquiry. I thought that it was madness for the developer to be proceeding with a scheme that was economically so bad, when there was an obligation to make a large upfront land payment. I believed that the only explanation for this was that the developer had a second, higher valuation for the scheme. However, when I put this to Sue Cocking of Knight Frank at the public inquiry she told the inspector that she was not aware of any other valuation having been provided. 

It is completely inplausable that Knight Frank were unaware of the fact that they had produced two valuations.
