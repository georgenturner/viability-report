# 8 Albert Embankment

A very similar issue occurred at 8 Albert Embankment.

8 Albert Embankment is the former headquarters of the London Fire Brigade. In 2011 plans to build new luxury housing on the site went to a public inquiry.

The developer's surveyors, Knight Frank, had produced a financial viability report that demonstrated that the development would not generate any land payment for the landowner. The residual land value was negative.

The target land value benchmark for the site was 0. In other words the FVA said that even after getting the land for free, the developer would not make enough profit in order to attract finance for the deal or pay for the land. This assessment was the basis of the developers request for the council to reduce the requirement to build affordable housing, which they acceded to.

However, in secret, the Fire Authority had agreed a £40m up front payment for the land if the scheme were granted planning permission. Again this was only revealed after campaigners managed to obtain confidential documentation from the Fire Authority.

The real land value is never used as a benchmark in an FVA for reasons that will be discussed below. However, if the FVA is showing that the developemnt will not make enough money to make any land payment, and at the same time the developer has agreed to pay £40m for the land, then there must be something very wrong with the FVA. 

Only a developer who was insane would proceed with the development on the basis of the FVA submitted to the council beause if they did they would not have the profit necessary to pay their obligation to the land owner and would most likely become bankrupt.

But of course, the developer in this case was not insane. Though the Freedom of Information Act we found that the developer had written to Sue Foster at Lambeth Council, Director of Regneration at Lambeth Council, to tell her that the valuations submitted to the council in the viability assessment did not represent the ‘true’ viability position of the scheme. Sue Foster, never asked the developer what the 'true' position was, and Lambeth’s surveyors, BNP Paribas, agreed with the untrue valuations. The community was forced to fight the case for affordable housing alone.

Later we would find the 'true' valuation in the investors presentation for the Shell Centre. This presentation, which was produced in the same month as the public inquiry into the 8 Albert Embankment scheme listed expected sales values on nearby buildings, including 8 Albert Embankment, which was listed as Florian Place \(Florian being the patron saint of fire fighters\).

The values for Florian Place listed in the Shell investor presentation were 30% higher than those listed in the FVA. At the higher values the development started to make financial sense. The higher sales values would generate profit which would allow the land payment to be achieved.

However, had the land payment and the real valuation been the argument to reduce the requirement to build affordable housing would have been much harder to make.

The Shell investors presentation was not the only evidence that the developers in this case knew more than they were letting on. The total development value of the site in the FVA was around £170m. However, on Native Land's own website the gross development value was listed as £230m.

Again, in this case the planning inspector found in favour of the developer on this point (although he rejected the scheme on other issues). His report clearly shows that he felt compelled to accept the conclusions of the professionals above the objections of the community, despite their real evidence that the viability assessments were being docotored.
