# The Land

Land is a key variable in the FVA process. It can either be used as a cost of development, where the FVA is seeking to determine what profit the developer will make. 

Alternatively the developer's profit could be inputted into the FVA as a fixed cost \(usually a % of the value of the development\) and the FVA outputs a land value. In those circumstancs the viability assessment looks at the revenues of the new building, subtracts the building costs and a fixed allowance for the developers profit. The number left over \(called the residual land value\) is not the real amount of money paid for the land, but the maximum amount of cash available to pay the landowner after the development is completed. 

Where the FVA outputs a land value then financial viability is achieved if the number the FVA produces is greater than an agreed land value benchmark. That benchmark is usually the value of the land in its existing use. The logic is that if a landowner can get more money from selling the land to be developed than if they sold the land in its existing use, then they will sell it to a developer and the development is financially viable.

Clearly the setting of the benchmark land value between the council and the developer is a crucial part of the viability process. If the developer manages to convince the council that the current use value of the site is higher than it actually is, then financial viability will be more difficult to achieve and planning obligations will be removed unnecessarily. 

## 12-20 Wyvil Road

12-20 Wyvil Road site comprises of a small 1950s office building and an old hall used as a roller disco. The development proposed is a tower which includes 219 apartments and office space. It is difficult to image how land used for high end luxury housing could be worth less than land used for a clapped out low rise office building, but that is the case that the developer, and Savills, their consultants, made to Lambeth council when requesting whether it could build fewer affordable housing units that were necessary to meet local need.

The trick was all in the land value benchmark chosen - £30m. 

In this case the number used was not the existing use value of the site, it would have been extremely difficult to convince anyone, even Lambeth's accomodating planners, that the buildings were worth £30m, but the number was what developers claimed was the “market value” of the site.

The use of market value rather than current use value as a benchmark has some support from RICS, although the practice is quite controvertial and there is some coflict between the approach taken by RICS and the government. 

The fear is that if the current market for land is being inflated by unrealistic expectations from developers then developers can overpay for the land and the council will be compelled to drop planning obligations to help them make up the deficit.

The figure that should never be used as a benchmark is the acutal price paid by the developer for similar reasons. In that case financial viability will only be achieved if the development meets the amount of money the developer chose to pay. And if the developer paid too much then the palanning obligations will give way.  

For this reason RICS puts an important qualification on the use of market value. When it is used as a benchmark the value should take into account the cost of meeting all planning obligations.

The government also stresses the importance of this in their NPPG, which says:

> In all cases, land or site value should:
>  
> reflect policy requirements and planning obligations and, where applicable, any Community Infrastructure Levy charge
  
That was exactly what did not happen in this case. Instead of working out what an appropriate land value that priced in the need to build affordable housing, Savills looked at real market transactions and used those values as a benchmark. The problem was that all of the sites they used did not meet the council’s planning obligations, particularly in relation to affordable housing.
 
In the examples they used, the extra money the development could generate from dropping affordable housing was priced into the land.
 
In effect, what the developer was telling the council was that in order to be financially viable, the development had to outperform other developments in the area that had already been allowed to drop their affordable housing obligations. With this benchmark, achieving a development with a full complement of affordable housing would be impossible. The developer set themselves an impossible task, failed and then asked the council to help them at everybody elses expense.

Profits

The use of the market value gave the developer and land owner a huge advantage in their negotiations. It was also very profitable. On our calculations if the council had insisted on doing the viability assessment on the basis of an existing use value the benchmark figure would have been around £2.7m, rather than the £30m they used. That means that in all likelihood the council could have insisted on much more affordable housing, and a lower profit for the landowners and developers. We can estimate this by using other confidential documents in our possession relating to the neighbouring site, Vauxhall Sky Gardens, where the existing use value was just £900,000.

The Vauxhall Sky Gardens (VSG) site had similar industrial buildings on it, it is also just one third of the size of the 12-20 Wyvil Road site. If we take the existing use value of the VSG site and multiply by three we get a ballpark figure of £2.7m. That is, less than ten times the benchmark used on the 12-20 Wyvil Road application.

Why did the developer and land owner use such a vastly inflated land value? Perhaps it could be because that is what was eventually paid for the land. In 2015, with the benefit of planning permission, the landowners sold the land to Grand South Ltd, a company registered in Jersey for £30m. And although the land transaction happened after planning permission was granted, it is common practice in the development industry to agree a price before planning and then execute the transaction after it has been secured, to make sure that the increase in value from the change of use is secured by the landowner.

If that did happen this is exactly the situation planning authorities and RICS tried to avoid. A developer agrees to pay a high price for land on the basis of profits that can be achieved if a development with little or no affordable housing is built.

The developer then uses that land value to justify not building affordable housing to the planning authority. In effect the public loses because a landowner, in this case Network Rail, decided to get greedy.

The “Market Values”

Below are the market values used as comparables for the viability appraisal for 12-20 Wyvil Road. It should have been obvious from the benchmarks chosen that building a policy compliant development in terms of affordable housing would have been impossible.

Land prices 12-20 Wyvil Road

In order to generate comparable figures using the plots chosen Savills took the price transacted, applied inflation and then multiplied the price to make up for any difference in size of the plots of land. In some cases a discount was applied if the development was sold after planning permission had been granted.

Parliament House is a tower of luxury housing behind the Albert Embankment which was granted planning permission in 2008 for a 23 story tower containing 31% affordable housing, all to be sold on a shared ownership basis. Planning policy requires 40% affordable housing with 70% being at social rent.

Parliament House
There is a similar story at Hampton House, currently being built and renamed “The Corniche”. Here the proposal was to build 33% affordable housing as ‘senior living’ accommodation.

Vauxhall Sky Gardens, another comparable on the list, had a land value of £10.9m. As we wrote in our last blog, the proposals in this case was for a building with just 17% affordable housing.
