# The Land

Land is a key variable in the FVA process. It can either be inputted into the FVA as a cost of development, where the FVA is seeking to determine what profit the developer will make. 

Alternatively land value can be an output of the FVA process. In this case developer's profit is inputted into the FVA as a fixed cost \(usually a % of the value of the development\). 

In those circumstances the viability assessment looks at the revenues of the new building, subtracts the building costs and a fixed allowance for the developers profit. The number left over \(called the residual land value\) is not the real amount of money paid for the land, but the maximum amount of cash available to pay the landowner after the development is completed. 

Where the FVA outputs a land value then financial viability is achieved if the number the FVA produces is greater than an agreed land value benchmark. 

But whichever method is used the developer and the council will need to agree on a notional land value.

That benchmark is usually the value of the land in its existing use. The logic is that if a landowner can get more money from selling the land to be developed than if they sold the land in its existing use, then they will sell it to a developer and the development is financially viable.

Clearly the setting of the benchmark land value between the council and the developer is a crucial part of the viability process. If the developer manages to convince the council that the current use value of the site is higher than it actually is, then financial viability will be more difficult to achieve and planning obligations could be removed unnecessarily.
