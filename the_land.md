# The Land

Land value is one of the two viability benchmarks.

Where land value is an output of the FVA, the FVA  equation starts with the revenues of the new building, subtracts the building costs and a fixed allowance for the developers profit. The number left over \(called the residual land value\) is not the real amount of money paid for the land, but the maximum amount of cash available to pay the landowner after the development is completed.

Financial viability is achieved if the number the FVA produces is greater than an agreed land value target benchmark.

That benchmark is usually the value of the land in its existing use. The logic is that if a landowner can get more money from selling the land to be developed than if they sold the land in its existing use, then they will sell it to a developer and the development is financially viable.

Clearly the setting of the benchmark land value between the council and the developer is a crucial part of the viability process. If the developer manages to convince the council that the current use value of the site is higher than it actually is, then financial viability will be more difficult to achieve and planning obligations could be removed unnecessarily.

A major development in Southwark provids a striking example of how much these benchmarks can be inflated. In 2008 a developer convinced Southwark Council that its ['Tribeca Square'](http://35percent.org/tribeca-square/) site was worth £18m for the purposes of working out the affordable housing obligation - £10m more than it had actually paid for the site a year earlier.
