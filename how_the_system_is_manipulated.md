# How the system is manipulated

As a result of changes to government policy, an industry has built up to exploit the financial viability system to generate profits for developers. 

The incentives in the system are obvious. If a developer can convince the planning authority that a proposed development is 'financially unviable' then they can get rid of all sorts of planning conditions that allows them to boost their profits. 

The word convince is important. The process is not about the real viability of the scheme. 

Financial viability assessments, by their nature, are based on predictions and estimates. This are highly subjective. If a developer puts together a financial viability assessment that underestimates the revenues of the scheme (for example, from the sales of new homes) and over estimates the costs of the scheme, then that will present an picture that a development that is going to make lower profits, and will therefore be less financially viable. If the developer can take this pessimistic view of viability, and convince the council that it is reasonable, then they can get the council to drop planning obligations and increase their profits. 

This increase in profits, and the *unnecssary* damage that must follow from abandoning the development plan 

Evidence collected by ourcity.london and others show that firms of surveyors have been creating viability assessments which provide purposefully inaccurate representations of the viability of the scheme. These are made with the sole purpose of reducing the planning obligations on their clients. 

The system is very similar to the world of tax avoidance by multi-natonal corporations. Multi-nationals have an incentive to show tax authorities in countries where they operate overseas that they are making low profits and are therefore only obliged to pay little or no tax on their profits.  

To achieve this accounting firms have developed a whole panoply of
