# How the system is manipulated

If a developer can produce a financial viability assessment that is overly pessimistic, that makes the development proposal appear much less profitable than it is in reality. This will allow the developer to get rid of all sorts of planning conditions and boost their profits when in reality they would have been able to build without planning subsidy.

Surveyors can achieve this outcome for their clients by manipulating the inputs into the viability equation. For example, if the costs are overestimated, and the revenues of a scheme underestimated then the profit shown in an FVA will be lower than it will be in reality and the scheme will appear to be unviable when it isn't.

The other way of manipulating the assessment is to set benchmarks, profit targets and land costs, that are unrealistically high. In this case developers are telling the council that they will not be able to finance their scheme or purchase the land to build unless the hit a certain benchmark profit level, when in reality they could do so even if the scheme produced a lower profit.

In both cases, if surveyors can create an FVA that shows that their project will be unviable, then they can gain a subsidy from the planning authority which is _unnecssary_ to meet the policy goal of encouraging development and gained at the public expense.

All financial viability assessments are not based on real figures, but on estimates. It is the job of the surveyor to arrive at an estimate though using their professional judgement. Of course, this means that two surveyors can come up with different opinions on the viability of a scheme. However at what point does the space for legitimate difference of opinion end and deliberalte manipulation start?

In my view the answer must lie in behaviour of the surveyor. If it can be demonstrated that an opinion of the surveyor could not be honestly held, or that she has rejected the usual professional guidance on how to reach an estimate with the purpose of providing a more favourable outcome for their client, then that must be strong evidence that the financial viability test is being manipulated. 

The following examples demonstrate how surveyors have manipulated the various inputs and benchmarks in the financial viability system in order to remove affordable housing and other development benefits from major development schemes.
