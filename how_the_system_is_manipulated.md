# How the system is manipulated

As a result of changes to government policy, an industry has built up to exploit the financial viability system to generate profits for developers. 

The incentives are obvious. If a developer can produce a financial viability assessment that is overly pesamistic, that underestimates revenues, and overestimates costs then the development proposal will appear much less profitable than it is in reality. This will allow the developer to get rid of all sorts of planning conditions and boost their profits. 

The issue that faces planners, regulators and communities is that FVAs, by their nature, are based on predictions and estimates that are highly subjective. One surveyor can have an honest disagreement with another about what the real value of something is, the timing of valuations is also a factor, and this means that there is often no right or wrong answer when it comes to determining financial viability. 

But where do those shades of grey fade to back. Where does the space for genuine, honeslty held disagreement about the viability of a scheme end, and fraud begin? 

The answer to that must be about intent. What was the intention of the surveyor when they created their FVA? Was it to produce a genuine and honest assessment of the viability position of the scheme? or a misleading one? 

Evidence collected by ourcity.london and others suggest that firms of surveyors have been creating viability assessments which provide purposefully inaccurate representations of the viability of the scheme. These are made with the sole purpose of reducing the planning obligations on their clients and increasing their profits. 

This increase in profits, and the *unnecssary* damage that must follow from abandoning the development plan is a mechanism for turning a public good into private profit.

The system is very similar to the world of tax avoidance by multi-natonal corporations. Multi-nationals have an incentive to show tax authorities in countries where they operate overseas that they are making low profits and are therefore only obliged to pay little or no tax on their profits.  

To achieve this accounting firms have developed a whole panoply of accounting tricks to allow corporations to shift profits out of a subsidiary they own in one country and into another company they own, usually located in a tax haven. 

The surveying industry have become to developers, what accounts have become to multi-national corporations.
