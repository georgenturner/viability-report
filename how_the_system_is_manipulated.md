# How the system is manipulated

As a result of changes to government policy, an industry has built up to exploit the financial viability system to generate profits for developers. 

The incentives are obvious. If a developer can produce a financial viability assessment that is overly pesamistic, that underestimates revenues, and overestimates costs then the development proposal will appear much less profitable than it is in reality. This will allow the developer to get rid of all sorts of planning conditions and boost their profits. 

This can be achieved by manipulating the inputs into the viability equation. The viability equation is relatively simple and easy to understand by the layperson. 

David Henry of Savills, who appeared on behalf of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors recently told the Environment Select Committee of the House of Lords:

>"Many people become rather scared of this issue of viability. What is it? Essentially, it is a simple financial equation. There are many ways of approaching that equation. There is a disposal price, a sale price, a cost of construction, a total development cost, and a residual sumâ€”a land value or whatever it is. Viability comes into this discussion when changes in the total development cost impact on one or other of those outriggers, whether it is the sale price or the residual land value; something gives somewhere in the equation."

Put very simply the viability equation is the revenues of the development, minus the costs

Evidence collected by ourcity.london and others suggest that firms of surveyors have been creating viability assessments which provide purposefully inaccurate representations of the viability of the scheme. These are made with the sole purpose of reducing the planning obligations on their clients and increasing their profits. 

This increase in profits, and the *unnecssary* damage that must follow from abandoning the development plan is a mechanism for turning a public good into private profit.

The system is very similar to the world of tax avoidance by multi-natonal corporations. Multi-nationals have an incentive to show tax authorities in countries where they operate overseas that they are making low profits and are therefore only obliged to pay little or no tax on their profits.  

To achieve this accounting firms have developed a whole panoply of accounting tricks to allow corporations to shift profits out of a subsidiary they own in one country and into another company they own, usually located in a tax haven. 

The surveying industry have become to developers, what accounts have become to multi-national corporations.
