## 12-20 Wyvil Road

12-20 Wyvil Road site comprises of a small 1950s office building and an old hall used as a roller disco. The development proposed is a tower which includes 219 apartments and office space. 

It is difficult to image how land used for high end luxury housing could be worth less than land used for a clapped out low rise office building, but that is the case that the developer, and Savills, their consultants, made to Lambeth council when requesting whether it could build fewer affordable housing units that were necessary to meet local need.

The trick was all in the land value benchmark chosen - £30m. In this case the number used was not the existing use value of the site, it would have been extremely difficult to convince anyone, even Lambeth's accomodating planners, that the buildings were worth £30m, but the number was what developers claimed was the “market value” of the site.

The use of market value rather than current use value as a benchmark has some support from RICS, although the practice is quite controvertial and there is some coflict between the approach taken by RICS and the government. 

The fear is that if the current market for land is being inflated by unrealistic expectations from developers then developers can overpay for the land and the council will be compelled to drop planning obligations to help them make up the deficit.

The figure that should never be used as a benchmark is the acutal price paid by the developer for similar reasons. In that case financial viability is circular. Viability will only be achieved if the development meets the amount of money the developer chose to pay. And if the developer paid too much then the palanning obligations will give way. The developer knowing this can bid more for the land, knowing that they will be able to achieve the excess profit reqired by getting rid of planning obligations. 

For these reasons RICS puts an important qualification on the use of market value. When it is used as a benchmark the value should take into account the cost of meeting all planning obligations.

The government also stresses the importance of this in their NPPG, which says:> In all cases, land or site value should:
> reflect policy requirements and planning obligations and, where applicable, any Community Infrastructure Levy charge.  

That was exactly what did not happen in this case. Instead of working out an appropriate land value that priced in the cost of building affordable housing, Savills looked at real market transactions and used those values as a benchmark. The problem was that all of the sites they used did not meet the council’s planning obligations, particularly in relation to affordable housing. 

In the examples they used, the extra money the development could generate from dropping affordable housing was priced into the land. In effect, what the developer was telling the council was that in order to be financially viable, the development had to outperform other developments in the area that had already been allowed to drop their affordable housing obligations. 

With this benchmark, achieving a development with a full complement of affordable housing would be impossible. The developer set themselves an impossible task, failed and then asked the council to help them at everybody elses expense.

##Profit
Using land values in this way was hugely profitable for the developer and the land owner. On my calculations if the council had insisted on doing the viability assessment on the basis of an existing use value the benchmark figure would have been around £2.7m, rather than the £30m they used. 

This figure is arrived at by looking at Vauxhall Sky Gardens, the neighbouring site which is next door to 12-20 Wyvil Road. The Vauxhall Sky Gardens (VSG) site had similar industrial buildings on it, and in the viability study submitted to the council it valued the exiting use value of the site at £900,000. The site is also just one third of the size of the 12-20 Wyvil Road site. If we take the existing use value of the VSG site and multiply by three we get a ballpark figure of £2.7m. That is, less than ten times the benchmark used on the 12-20 Wyvil Road application. 

Had the council insisted on using the existing use value of the site at 12-20 Wyvil Road, it is obvious that they could have insisted on much more affordable housing, and a lower profit for the landowners and developers. 

But the story doesnt end there. In 2015, with the benefit of planning permission, the landowners sold the land to Grand South Ltd, a company registered in Jersey for £30m. And although the land transaction happened after planning permission was granted, it is common practice in the development industry to agree a price before planning and then execute the transaction after it has been secured, to make sure that the increase in value from the change of use is secured by the landowner.

In effect, what the developers had managed to achieve was exactly the situation planning authorities and RICS say should not happen. A developer agrees to pay a high price for land on the basis of profits that can be achieved if a development with little or no affordable housing is built. The developer then uses that land value to justify not building affordable housing to the planning authority. 

##The “Market Values”
Below are the market values used as comparables for the viability appraisal for 12-20 Wyvil Road. It should have been obvious from the benchmarks chosen that building a policy compliant development in terms of affordable housing would have been impossible.

In order to generate comparable figures using the plots chosen Savills took the price transacted, applied inflation and then multiplied the price to make up for any difference in size of the plots of land. In some cases a discount was applied if the development was sold after planning permission had been granted.

###Parliament house

Parliament House is a tower of luxury housing behind the Albert Embankment which was granted planning permission in 2008 for a 23 story tower containing 31% affordable housing, all to be sold on a shared ownership basis. Planning policy requires 40% affordable housing with 70% being at social rent.
###Hampton House

There is a similar story at Hampton House, currently being built and renamed “The Corniche”. Here the proposal was to build 33% affordable housing as ‘senior living’ accommodation.

###Vauxhall Sky Gardens
![](http://www.ourcity.london/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/VSG-profile_03.jpg)Vauxhall Sky Gardens, another comparable on the list, had a land value of £10.9m. The proposals in this case was for a building with just 17% affordable housing.
