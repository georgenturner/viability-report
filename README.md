# Introduction

Over the last few years the government has implemented a number of policies designed to encourage private developers to build more homes. The assumption underlying many of the policy proscriptions is that the house building industry is being prevented from meeting the demand for new homes, which is in turn pushing up prices. In the eyes of policy makers the main blockage is the planning system. In parotiuclar, the development industy has argued that planning requirements, such as the need to provide good quality homes, open spaces, and affordable housing, reduce profits to the point where development is not viable. 

To remedy this government has placed greater emphasis on the financial viability policy, which allows planning authorities to reduce planning obligations, usually the requirement to build affordable housing, if a developer can show that their schemes is struggling with its finances.

The policy has had a real impact. In 2013 a [study](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2013/09/18/thousands-of-affordable-homes-axed/) by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that 60% of new developments had taken advantage of the increased flexibility in the planning system to drop affordable housing targets. 

But it is not just affordable housing where this policy has had an impact. Planning authorities can and frequently do allow all sorts of other planning obligations to be relaxed in order to help a developer make a scheme more financially viable. This includes restrictions on the height of buildings and can have a significant effect on the preservation of historic buildings.

## Controversy

For some time the financial viability policy has become increasingly controversial. There has been a concern that the process has been used to allow developers to avoid planning requirements unjustifiably. 

Clearly, on a macro level, something is going very wrong with the policy. Since 2010, when the government started to, profits in the development industry have exploded. Looking at the top five house builders in the UK, their profits have increased by over five times in six years.

Developers claim that their schemes are financially unviable in order to persuade a planning authority to drop planning obligations, when in reality they could have been met. The result of this is that developers get to increase their profits at the expense of important social needs such as affordable housing, open spaces and our historic environment.

This concern was articulated in a detailed [article](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) on the subject by Oliver Wainwright, the Guardian's architecture critic.

> "In the last decade, London has lost 8,000 social-rented homes. Under the Tory-led coalition, the amount of affordable housing delivered across the country fell by a third – from 53,000 homes completed in 2010 to 36,000 in 2014. Much of the reason lies hidden in these developers’ viability assessments and the dark arts of accounting, which have become all-powerful tools in the way our cities are being shaped."

Planning authorities have also raised concerns. Islington council recently told the House of Lords Environment committee:

> Developers’ viability assessments are systematically pessimistic in their assumptions about
> their ability to deliver planning obligations such as affordable housing and
> supporting infrastructure.

The committee in their recent report 'Building better places' called for national planning guidance to be revised in light of their findings that the financial viability system has been used to undermine the planning process:

> We believe there is therefore a compelling case to revise national planning policy and guidance to ensure that individual viability assessments do not systematically undermine the delivery of affordable housing and other planning obligations.

The previous Mayor, Boris Johnson at a mayoral question time referred to viability assessments as a 'dark art'.

The suspicion around the process is exacerbated by the secrecy surrounding the system. Frequently on development applications, the public and _even the decision makers themselves_ will be asked to trust the work of surveyors in their determination of a schemes viability. They are unable to check for themselves as the documentation is kept secret.

This secrecy hinders policy makers in effectively dealing with the issue, but it also provides opportunities to conceal misconduct on the part of planning professionals.

## The guardians of the system

Surveyors are the guardians of the financial viability system. They create the inputs, the valuations of potential sales revenues and costs that determine whether or not a development is financially viable. Given the lack of scrutiny that these figures are subject to, a great deal of trust has to be placed in surveyors. If a surveyor is dishonest or incompetent then the problems this can cause for the viability system are obvious.

Unfortunately that trust is often abused. This report describes how the financial viability policy can be manipulated. It lays out the evidence which shows how leading firms of surveyors will frequently create bespoke valuations for the purposes of eliminating planning obligations for their clients.

In doing so they create a sharp boost for their clients at the public expense.

This practice is not permitted by some loophole in the legislation or guidance around the policy. The evidence shows that firms will consistently disregard published guidance, and well established professional practice when creating their viability appraisals if it will allow their clients to avoid planning obligations.

What is of most concern is that the practice appears to be endemic within the industry. It is not something carried out by small, aggressive and disreputable firms, but by the largest surveying firms in the world. The cases outlined in this report are most likely to be the tip of the iceberg.

The issue is very similar to the problem of tax avoidance by multinational companies. Over the last few decades the large accountancy firms have begun to market schemes to allow large multinational companies to avoid taxes which should otherwise be paid. Often these schemes rely on the professionals tailoring their judgement about how accounting rules should be applied to meet their client's wishes.

When large firms avoid their tax obligations the harm this causes to public interest is obvious, and as a result the practice of tax avoidance is becoming increasingly socially unacceptable. The practice of affordable housing avoidance should be equally socially unacceptable.

In the world of the built environment, the responsibility to police the ethics of the profession lies squarely with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, who have a statutory duty to take action against surveyors who threaten to bring the profession into disrepute.

The evidence in this report has been presented to RICS as part of a complaint into the three firms named in the examples cited. Given the national importance of this issue, if RICS is to restore trust in their profession, they must take firm action.

However, there must be further action in the form of policy change to make sure these kinds of practices are made much harder, in order to protect the public interest.
