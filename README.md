#Introduction

The UK is struggling to housing itself. The country is experiencing a deep and prolonged housing crisis which has put housing and planning at the top of the political agenda. 

Politicians and policy makers are all clear that that the answer lies in building more homes. To support this they have passed legislation to reduce planning obligations on developers and to make it easier to drop affordable housing requirements if schemes are struggling with their finances.

At the same time Local authorities and the planning inspectorate have been encouraged to be be accommodating to developers and help them to bring forward development by lowering the burden of planning obligations. 

The policy has had a real impact on the delivery of affordable housing in particular. In 2013 a [study](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2013/09/18/thousands-of-affordable-homes-axed/) by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that 60% of new developments across the country are failing to meet their affordable housing targets. In every case this was because developers claimed that the profitability of their schemes was so marginal that it was simply not possible to build the required amount of affordable housing.

But it is not just affordable housing where this policy has had an impact. Planning authorities can and frequently do allow all sorts of other planning obligations to be relaxed in order to help a developer make a scheme more financially viable. 

##Controversy

For some time the financial viability process has become increasingly controversial. There has been a concern that the process has been used to allow developers to avoid planning requirements, when in reality they could have been met. 

This concern was articulated in a detailed [article]( https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) on the subject by Oliver Wainwright, the Guardian's architecture critic. 

>"In the last decade, London has lost 8,000 social-rented homes. Under the Tory-led coalition, the amount of affordable housing delivered across the country fell by a third – from 53,000 homes completed in 2010 to 36,000 in 2014. Much of the reason lies hidden in these developers’ viability assessments and the dark arts of accounting, which have become all-powerful tools in the way our cities are being shaped."[^]

Planning authorities have also raised concerns. Islington council in January 2016 published a supplementary planning document on development viability. 

>Despite viability becoming a central part of the planning process, there has been relatively wide scope and discretion for how viability matters are dealt with. The council’s experience is that in some instances this has led to the use of inappropriate approaches to assessing viability and this has come into conflict with the principle of sustainable development and the plan-led system. 

The previous Mayor, Boris Johnson at a mayoral question time referred to viability assessments as a 'dark art' and the House of Lords environment committee in their recent report 'Building better places' also raised concerns about the viability process: 

>We believe there is therefore a compelling case to revise national planning policy and guidance to ensure that individual viability assessments do not systematically undermine the delivery of affordable housing and other planning obligations.

The suspicion around the process is exacerbated by the secrecy surrounding the system. 

##A system broken
These authorities are right to be concerned. Over several years investigating the development industry I have collected evidence which demonstrates that leading surveyors are creating
