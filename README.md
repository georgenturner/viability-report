#Introduction

The UK is struggling to housing itself. The country is experiencing a deep and prolonged housing crisis which has put housing and planning at the top of the political agenda. 

Politicians and policy makers are all clear that that the answer lies in building more homes. To support this they have passed legislation to reduce planning obligations on developers and to make it easier to drop affordable housing requirements if schemes are struggling with their finances.

At the same time local authorities and the planning inspectorate have been encouraged to be flexible and help developers to bring forward development by lowering the burden of planning obligations. 

The policy has had a real impact on the delivery of affordable housing in particular. In 2013 a [study](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2013/09/18/thousands-of-affordable-homes-axed/) by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that 60% of new developments across the country are failing to meet their affordable housing targets. In every case this was because developers claimed that the profitability of their schemes was so marginal that it was simply not possible to build the required amount of affordable housing.

But it is not just affordable housing where this policy has had an impact. Planning authorities can and frequently do allow all sorts of other planning obligations to be relaxed in order to help a developer make a scheme more financially viable. This includes restrictions on the height of buildings and can have a significant effect on the preservation of historic buildings.

##Controversy

For some time the financial viability process has become increasingly controversial. There has been a concern that the process has been used to allow developers to avoid planning requirements, when in reality they could have been met. 

This concern was articulated in a detailed [article]( https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) on the subject by Oliver Wainwright, the Guardian's architecture critic. 

>"In the last decade, London has lost 8,000 social-rented homes. Under the Tory-led coalition, the amount of affordable housing delivered across the country fell by a third – from 53,000 homes completed in 2010 to 36,000 in 2014. Much of the reason lies hidden in these developers’ viability assessments and the dark arts of accounting, which have become all-powerful tools in the way our cities are being shaped."[^]

Planning authorities have also raised concerns. Islington council recntly told the House of Lords Environment committee:

>Developers’ viability assessments are systematically pessimistic in their assumptions about
their ability to deliver planning obligations such as affordable housing and
supporting infrastructure.

The committee in their recent report 'Building better places' called for national planning guidance to be revised in light of their findings that the financial viability system has been used to undermine the planning process: 

>We believe there is therefore a compelling case to revise national planning policy and guidance to ensure that individual viability assessments do not systematically undermine the delivery of affordable housing and other planning obligations.

The previous Mayor, Boris Johnson at a mayoral question time referred to viability assessments as a 'dark art'. 

The suspicion around the process is exacerbated by the secrecy surrounding the system. Frequently on development applications, the public and even the decision makers themselves will be asked to trust the work of surveyors in their determination of a schemes viability. They are unable to check for themselves as the documentation is kept secret. 

##A system broken by misconduct
These authorities are right to be concerned. Over several years investigating the development industry I have collected evidence which demonstrates serious issues in the professional conduct of surveyors involved in the financial viability system.  

This evidence has led me to the opinion that some leading firms of surveyors are have developed a practice of creating fraudulent valuations for the purpose of helping their clients to negotiate away planning constraints on their sites. This practice provides an easy fix to boost their clients interest, but does so at the expense of the public interest. 

The evidence is related to three firms of surveyors, Knight Frank LLP, Savills and Quod and covers a number of major developments in London. 

As will be demonstrated, this practice is not permitted by some loophole in the legislation or guidance around financial viability assessments. The evidence shows that these firms will consistently disregard published guidance, and well established professional practice when creating their viability appraisals if it will allow their clients to avoid planning obligations. 

What is of most concern is that the practice appears to be endemic in these consultancies. It is part of their offer to their clients, which means that the cases outlined below are most likely merely the tip of the iceberg. 

This evidence is being presented to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) as part of a complaint into the three firms named in this report. 

The behaviour outlined in this report is clearly a breach of the firms professional obligations.

Given the national importance of this issue, if RICS is to restore trust in their profession, they must take firm action.
