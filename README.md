# Introduction

The UK is struggling to housing itself. The country is experiencing a deep and prolongued housing crisis which has put housing and planning at the top of the politicial agenda. 

Politicians and policy makers are all clear that that the answer lies in building more homes. To support this they have passed legislation to reduce planning obligations on developers and to make it easier to drop affordable housing requiremnts if schemes are struggling with their finances.

At the same time Local authorities and the planning inspectorate have been encouraged to be be accomodating to developers and help them to bring forward development by lowering the burden of plannning obligations. 

The policy has had a real impact on the delivery of affordable housing in particular. In 2013 a [study](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2013/09/18/thousands-of-affordable-homes-axed/) by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that 60% of new developments across the country are failing to meet their affordable housing targets. In every case this was because developers claimed that the profitability of their schemes was so marginal that it was simply not possible to build the required amount of affordable housing.

But it is not just affordable housing where this policy has had an impact. Planning authoriries can and frequently do allow all sorts of other planning obligations to be relaxed in order to help a developer make a scheme more financially viable. 

The most stark example of this was at the Shell Centre in Central London. The Shell Centre occupies an extremely sensitive site. On the South Bank, in the setting of Parliament, it is surrounded by a collection of some of the most important historic monuments in the country. 

At the time of writing UNESCO are preparing a monitoring mission to London to decide whether to place the Westminster World Heritige site on the list of Word Heritiage in danger. The UN agency is worried about the amount of tall buildings being granted planning permission on the South Bank and Vauxhall. UNESCO have cited the proposals for the Shell Centre as a particulr concern.

When Shell brought forward plans to build 7 new tall buildings on the site, planners at Lambeth Council asked the developer whether they could remodel the scheme with less massing. This was primarly to protect the daylight of neighbouring residents, but it would have had the effect of reducing the scheme and causing less damage to the World Heritgae site.  

Jason Larkin, Head of Planning at Canary Wharf Group wrote a terse email to Lambeth's Planners. The one line email said "I should make clear that cut backs are not an option as it would render the scheme unviable. It is this scheme or nothing". 

##A heavy burden
Given the real impact that the policy of encouraging planning authorities to assist with the financial viability of developments has on the development of our cities, there is a particular burden on the industry to get financial viability right. 

Highly controvertial 

Secrecy has led to lack of scrutiny

>"In the last decade, London has lost 8,000 social-rented homes. Under the Tory-led coalition, the amount of affordable housing delivered across the country fell by a third – from 53,000 homes completed in 2010 to 36,000 in 2014. Much of the reason lies hidden in these developers’ viability assessments and the dark arts of accounting, which have become all-powerful tools in the way our cities are being shaped."[^]
