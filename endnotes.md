[^]: The existing use value was calculated by looking at the neighbouring site, Vauxhall Sky Gardens. In that planning application the surveyor used an EUV of Â£900,000 for a site which contained similar commerical buildings to the site at 12-20 Wyvil Road. The Vauxhall Sky Gardens site is 1/3 of the size of the 12-20 Wyvil Road site.
