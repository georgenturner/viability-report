# How viability works

The key to the system is the financial viability assessment (FVA), a tool for working out how much money a development will generate and how profitable it will be for the developer and land owner. An FVA sets out the revenues a development is expected to make and the cost of building it.

In order for the development to be viable, the money left over after the costs have been subtracted from the revenues must be enough to hit two numbers or viability benchmarks:

1. Enough profit for the developer to attract investors to finance the project
2. Enough money to persuade the land owner to part with their land


If a site can not achieve these benchmarks it is deemed to be financially unviable and the developer can ask the council to lower planning obligations (build less affordable housing, make fewer contributions to the community) in order to make a development viable.
