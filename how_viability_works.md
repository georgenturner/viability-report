# How viability works

The key document in the Financial Viability system is the financial viability assessment (FVA). 

If a developer wants to request that a planning authority remove planning obligations (affordable housing, childrens playspace, restrictions on rooms being too small), they submit an FVA to the council which demonstrates why the development is unviable. An FVA sets out the revenues a development is expected to make and the cost of building it.

What should be included in the FVA is set out in government guidance \(The National Planning Policy Guidance or NPPG\) and also industry guidance which is published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors \(RICS\) 

Most developers will general use established financial modeling software in order to construct their FVA. One model, called the Three Dragons Toolkit, was developed by the Mayor of London around ten years ago, others, such as Argus developer are sold on a commercial licence. 

## What is financially viable 

In order for the development to be viable, the money left over after the costs have been subtracted from the revenues must be enough to hit two numbers or viability benchmarks:

1. Enough profit for the developer to attract investors to finance the project
2. Enough money to persuade the land owner to part with their land

If a site can not achieve these benchmarks it is deemed to be financially unviable and the developer can ask the council to lower planning obligations \(build less affordable housing, make fewer contributions to the community\) in order to make a development viable.

The financial viabiliy benchmarks should be about finding minimums. What is the minimum amount of profit required in order to attract investment, and what is the minimum amount of money required to allow the land to come forward. 

The reason for this is that when a deveoper is presenting an FVA to a coucil they are asking for the council to help them to get more money by dropping planning obligations which are of public benefit. In effect they are asking for a subsidy from community, and this can only be justified if a development is genuinely unviable. 

If the development is viable and can meet the development plan then the developer is free to make as much profit as she likes, and free to pay the landowner however much money she wants.

Setting these benchmarks is a key part of the financial viability process and will be explored in subsequent chapters.
