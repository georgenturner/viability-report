# How financial viability in planning works

The key document in the financial viability system is the financial viability assessment (FVA). 

An FVA sets out the revenues a development is expected to make, the cost of building it and the expected profit.

At its heart financial viability in planning is a simple process. David Henry of Savills, who appeared on behalf of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors recently told the Environment Select Committee of the House of Lords:

>"Many people become rather scared of this issue of viability. What is it? Essentially, it is a simple financial equation. There are many ways of approaching that equation. There is a disposal price, a sale price, a cost of construction, a total development cost, and a residual sum â€” a land value or whatever it is. Viability comes into this discussion when changes in the total development cost impact on one or other of those outriggers, whether it is the sale price or the residual land value; something gives somewhere in the equation."

If a developer wants to request that a planning authority remove planning obligations they submit an FVA to the council which demonstrates why the development is unviable. 

Guidelines for how an FVA should be put together is provided by the government in the The National Planning Policy Guidance (NPPG) and also the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). 

Most developers will use established financial modeling software in order to construct their FVA. One model, called the Three Dragons Toolkit, was developed by the Mayor of London around ten years ago, others, such as Argus developer are sold on a commercial licence. 

## What is financially viable? 

Put very simply the viability equation is the revenues of the scheme minus the cost of building it. That equation produces a number. If that number allows the developer to meet two financial benchmarks then the scheme is viable. Those benchmarks are:

1. Enough profit for the developer to attract investors to finance the project
2. Enough cash to persuade the land owner to part with their land

If a site can not achieve these benchmarks it is deemed to be financially unviable and the developer can ask the council to lower planning obligations \(build less affordable housing, make fewer contributions to the community\) in order to make a development viable.

##Setting the benchmarks
Setting the financial viability benchmarks should be about finding minima. What is the minimum amount of profit required in order to attract investment, and what is the minimum amount of money required to allow the land to come forward. 

The reason for this is that when a developer is presenting an FVA to a council they are asking for the council to help them to increase their profits by dropping planning obligations which are of public benefit. In effect they are asking for a subsidy from the community, and this can only be justified if a development is genuinely unviable. 

If the development is viable and can meet the development plan then the developer is free to make as much profit as she likes, and free to pay the landowner however much money she wants.

Because these benchmarks are minimum threshold values they can be fixed in advance in agreement with the planning authority. This also allows the financial viability equation to be simplified further by incorporating either the developers profit or the land value is as a fixed cost. This means that the output only needs to beat the other of the two benchmarks. 

So in an example where cost of land is treated as a fixed cost the financial viability equation is: 

*Revenues* - *the minimum cost of land to bring forward land for development* - *cost of building* = *developer profit*  

In this case, for a building to be financially viable the developers profit must be enough to allow developers to pay back any loans and provide a return to investors that will persuade them to invest in the scheme.

In the example where land value is used as an output the equation is:

*Revenues* - *a fixed allowance for developers profit* - *cost of building* = *cash left over to pay land owner for land*

In this case the number at the end must be enough to persuade a land owner to part with their land. 

How these numbers are arrived at and agreed will be explained in further chapters.
