# How viability works

The key document in the financial viability system is the financial viability assessment (FVA). 

If a developer wants to request that a planning authority remove planning obligations (affordable housing, childrens' playspace, restrictions on rooms being too small), they submit an FVA to the council which demonstrates why the development is unviable. An FVA sets out the revenues a development is expected to make and the cost of building it.

What should be included in the FVA is set out in government guidance \(The National Planning Policy Guidance or NPPG\) and also industry guidance which is published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors \(RICS\) 

Most developers will general use established financial modeling software in order to construct their FVA. One model, called the Three Dragons Toolkit, was developed by the Mayor of London around ten years ago, others, such as Argus developer are sold on a commercial licence. 

## What is financially viable 
At its heart financial viability in planning is a simple process. 

David Henry of Savills, who appeared on behalf of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors recently told the Environment Select Committee of the House of Lords:

>"Many people become rather scared of this issue of viability. What is it? Essentially, it is a simple financial equation. There are many ways of approaching that equation. There is a disposal price, a sale price, a cost of construction, a total development cost, and a residual sum â€” a land value or whatever it is. Viability comes into this discussion when changes in the total development cost impact on one or other of those outriggers, whether it is the sale price or the residual land value; something gives somewhere in the equation."

Put very simply the viability equation is the revenues of the scheme minus the cost. If number that comes out at the end of that process allows the developer to meet two financial benchmarks then the scheme is viable. Those benchmarks are:

1. Enough profit for the developer to attract investors to finance the project
2. Enough money to persuade the land owner to part with their land

If a site can not achieve these benchmarks it is deemed to be financially unviable and the developer can ask the council to lower planning obligations \(build less affordable housing, make fewer contributions to the community\) in order to make a development viable.

The financial viabiliy benchmarks should be about finding minima. What is the minimum amount of profit required in order to attract investment, and what is the minimum amount of money required to allow the land to come forward. 

The reason for this is that when a deveoper is presenting an FVA to a coucil they are asking for the council to help them to increase their profits by dropping planning obligations which are of public benefit. In effect they are asking for a subsidy from the community, and this can only be justified if a development is genuinely unviable. 

If the development is viable and can meet the development plan then the developer is free to make as much profit as she likes, and free to pay the landowner however much money she wants.

Setting these benchmarks is a key part of the financial viability process and will be explored in subsequent chapters.
