# How viability works

The key document in the Financial Viability system is the financial viability assessment \(FVA\). 

If a developer wants to request that a planning authority remove planning obligations \(affordable housing, childrens playspace, restrictions on rooms being too small\), they submit an FVA to the council which demonstrates why the development is unviable. An FVA sets out the revenues a development is expected to make and the cost of building it.

What should be included in the FVA is set out in government guidance \(The National Planning Policy Guidance or NPPG\) and also industry guidance which is published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors \(RICS\) 

Most developers will general use established financial modeling software in order to construct their FVA. One model, called the Three Dragons Toolkit, was developed by the Mayor of London around ten years ago, others, such as Argus developer are sold on a commercial licence. 

## What is financially viable 

In order for the development to be viable, the money left over after the costs have been subtracted from the revenues must be enough to hit two numbers or viability benchmarks:

1. Enough profit for the developer to attract investors to finance the project
2. Enough money to persuade the land owner to part with their land

If a site can not achieve these benchmarks it is deemed to be financially unviable and the developer can ask the council to lower planning obligations \(build less affordable housing, make fewer contributions to the community\) in order to make a development viable.

Setting these benchmarks is a key part of the financial viability process and will be explored in subsequent chapters. However, it should be obvious that if the benchmarks are set too high
