# What is financial viability in planning

When planning authorities decide on whether or not a development should be granted permission to build they must by law determine the application in in line with the development plan. If the application is not in line with the plan, the planning authority can reject the application, if it is, the planning authority must approve it.  

The development plan comprises of a number of documents drawn up by different levels of government. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), a regional plan such as the London Plan and the Local Development Framework drawn up by the local planning authority. 

The planning documents that make up the development plan contain a whole host of requirements on developers, from how land should be used (i.e. should it be employment space or housing), to protecting the views and settings of historic buildings (and specifically which buildings), right down to design considerations such as the size of balconies. 

Key elements of the plan, such as the use of land, are based on evidence of need. For example, where there is a requirement for developers to build affordable housing, that requirement is based on the local demand for affordable housing in the area. 

The requirements of the plan are designed in consultation with the public and their purpose is to make sure that new developments are of a high quality, do not damage our environment, and respond to the needs and aspirations of the local community.

However, over a number of years a succession of governments have created a significant and growing loophole in the planning system, the need for planning authorities to have regard to the financial viability of developments when making planning decisions.

Under the current planning rules if a developer can show that their proposals are not financially viable, the obligation is on a local authority to remove planning conditions.

In other words, if a developer is not achieving an agreed level of profit then the planning authority must subsidise their profits by allowing them to depart from the development plan.

This is primarily achieved through the provision of fewer units of affordable housing, but as the provisions on financial viability have been expanded then more or less any planning obligation is able to be sacrificed if it will increase profits. That means not providing adequate open spaces, childrensâ€™ play spaces, community facilities or damaging historic buildings and the views of historic buildings.

For example, at the Shell Centre in Central London Shell and Canary Wharf Group proposed to build several tall buildings on the banks of the River Thames in the setting of the Westminster World Heritage Site. This application was made at a time when UNESCO had voiced increasing concern at impact of tall buildings on the World Heritage Site. 

During the application process planners at Lambeth asked to Canary Wharf Group to provide an alternative design for the scheme with smaller buildings, mainly due to concerns that the tall buildings would unacceptably impact the daylight to surrounding buildings. Jason Larkin, Head of Planning for Canary Wharf Group replied:

The scheme went onto be approved by the council after a positive recommendation from officers.
