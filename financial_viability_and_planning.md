# Financial viability and planning

When planning authorities decide on whether or not a development should be granted permission to build they must by law determine the application in in line with the development plan. If it does not, the planning authority can reject the application. If an application is in accordance with the plan, the planning authority must approve it.  

The development plan comprises of a number of documents drawn up by different levels of government. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), a regional plan such as the London Plan and the Local Development Framework drawn up by the local planning authority. 

The planning documents that make up the development plan contain a whole host of requirements on developers, from how land should be used (i.e. should it be employment space or housing), to protecting the views and settings of historic buildings (and specifically which buildings), right down to design considerations such as the size of balconies. 

Key elements of the plan, such as the use of land, are based on evidence of need. The local authority must create a plan which brings forward sites that meet the needs of the local community. 

The whole system is designed to ensure a democratic accountability towards the local built environment and sustainable development. The requirements of the plan are designed in consultation with the public and their purpose is to make sure that new developments are of a high quality, do not damage our environment, and respond to the needs and desires of the local community.

However, over a number of years a succession of governments have created a significant and growing loophole in the planning system, the need for planning authorities to have regard to the financial viability of developments.

Under the current planning rules if a developer can show that their proposals are not financially viable, the obligation is on a local authority to remove planning conditions.

In other words, if a developer is not achieving an agreed level of profit then the planning authority must subsidise their profits by allowing them to depart from the development plan.

This is primarily achieved through the provision of fewer units of affordable housing, but as the provisions on financial viability have been expanded then more or less any planning obligation is able to be sacrificed if it will increase profits. That mean not providing adequate open spaces, childrensâ€™ play spaces, community facilities or damaging historic buildings and the views of historic buildings.To put it bluntly under the current system developers profit comes first, town planning second.
