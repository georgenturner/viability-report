#Shell
The estimates of sales values of the new apartments at the Shell Centre were produced by Knight Frank and Savills. This claimed that the new flats on the site would sell for an average of £1,275 per square foot.

The study was checked by BNP Paribas on behalf of the local council. This agreed with the general premise that the building was unviable but thought the valuation to be a bit low. The document also reveals that Knight Frank and Savills put their case for the £1275 valuation forcefully. 

However, unknown to the council or anyone else, at the same time, Knight Frank and Savills produced a presentation for potential investors in the scheme which listed sales values on the site at £1641 per square foot.[^2] 

The second valuation was not disclosed to the planning authorities, it was only revealed after a presentation to investors was leaked to objectors to the scheme shortly before the public inquiry. 

After the second valuation had been revealed Mr John Rhodes, for Quod, who was giving evidence on this matter at the public inquiry in late November / early December 2013, claimed that the difference could be attributed to timing. The lower valuation was based on current values, the investors presentation was looking at possible future values. 

This was an unlikely explanation. The investors presentation listed the values as 'sales prices'. Another slide demonstrated that at the time the presentation was produced in February 2013, the developers were planning to put the new flats on the market in July of that year.

Even if we take into account that the origional FVA was submitted in December 2012 with the planning application, then Quod seem to have been expecting a 30% increase in sales prices in 6 months, a 60% per year rise. Even in the white heat of the London property market that seems scarcely credible.  

Neither did the explanation seem to tally with other data from the local housing market. 

CBRE, another surveyor, had published a report which said that at prime locations in the South Bank values had already achieved an average of £2,000 per square foot.  The Shell Centre is one of the most desirable locations in the area. 

In any event in April 2013, four months before Knight Frank and Savills had told investors that they were expecting to go to market at an average sales value of £1640 per square foot, Quod submitted an updated appraisal.  That assessment took on board some of the criticisms of the BNP review of the original FVA. Although it did not include higher sales prices for apartments as had been reccomended by BNP. In fact, an analysis of this viability appraisal appears to show that they used an even lower valuation of £1,205 per square foot for this appraisal.

In addition, it is important to understand that when a Secretary State calls in a planning application they are taking over consideration of the application and making their own decision.  

This process requires the applicant to submit the original planning application and any other further documentation they want to make their case to a government inspector. 

The RICS guidance states that where there is a planning inquiry, then the date of the viability assessment should be taken as the date of the submission of written representations. 

There are occasions where the appraisals
will require revisions. In certain circumstances,
as a result of, for example, fundamental market
changes or changes in density of the scheme,
between submission of the viability
assessment, application and consideration by
the planning authority, it will be necessary to
review and update the appraisal. This should,
however, relate to changes in the market, or
changes specific to the scheme, that would not
have been known at the time of the original
submission. Where there is a planning appeal,
the date should be agreed between the parties
or taken as the date of the hearing/written
representations.

the BNP review of the viability assessment was the only evidence submitted by the application. 

##The real values

When the flats went on sale just a few months later the values which Quod, Knight Frank and Savills claimed were 'future possible values' ended up looking very conservative. 

The Shell Centre is being sold in phases. The first building put on the market in September 2015 was tehn called One York Square. It appears to have now changed its name to One Casson Square. According to the Shell Investor presentation, which was Knight Franks and Savills of 'future sales values' One Casson Square could achieve sales values of £1,416 psf on average.  

When I checked the website for the new Shell Centre development, 'Southbank Place', sales values of apartments at One Casson Square ranged between £1800 and £2000 per square foot.

But that was just the cheapest residential building at the back of the site. In April 2016 Southbank Place had it's Hong Kong launch! To celebrate, the developer put on the market Thirty Casson Square.

The Southbank Place ‘Masterplan’ the residential buildings currently on sale are clustered to the back right of the picture, in the least desirable part of the development

In the origional Shell Centre FVA thirty Casson Square is valued at £1,254 per square foot on average. The investors presentation, which Mr Rhodes claimed before a planning inspector was based on estimates of future values, put the building at £1,469 psf.

But the sales values being marketed in Hong Kong? The Shell Centre website lists the currently available apartments. In April 2016 apartment 204, on level 2, the bottom of the building was on sale for £900,000. That is £1,404 per square foot.

Apartment 2303 is on the 23rd floor. It went on the market for £2m or £1,940 per square foot. In fact the cheapest apartment for sale on the website, a tiny 394 sq foot studio apartment (yours for just £655,000) came in at £1,662 per square foot.

The only reasonable conclusion to draw from this evidence is that the investors presentation was not a prediction of future values. In fact, the investors presentation was a reflection of the expected sales prices in July 2013, when the Shell Centre was expected to go on the market. The conclusion that flows from this is that the figures inputted into the viability assessment were deliberately underestimated by Knight Frank, Savills and Quod, in order to produce an unrealistically pessamistic picture of the real financial viability of the scheme.
