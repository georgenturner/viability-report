#Shell
The Shell Centre is a £1.6bn redevelopment of the Shell International Petroleum Corporation's Headquarters on London's South Bank. The scheme will add more than 800 new homes to the site. Lambeth Council requires that on new housing developments 40% is provided as affordable housing. 

The development was approved by Lambeth Council in May 2013 and was called in by the Secretary of State later that year. A public inquiry was held in December of 2013, I challenged the decision in the High Court in 2014 and the development finally received permission in 2015.

Quod, a planning consultancy acting for the developer submitted a financial viability assessment (FVA) with the application which claimed that the development was so financially unviable that no affordable hosuing was possible on the site. Regardless the developer was prepared to offer 10% on site and 10% offsite as a sign of goodwill. 

The FVA was based on estimates of the sales values of the new apartmentss produced by Knight Frank and Savills. This claimed that the new flats on the site would sell for an average of £1275 per square foot.


The study was checked by BNP Paribas on behalf of the local council. This agreed with the general premise that the building was unviable but thought the valuation to be a bit low. The document also reveals that Knight Frank and Savills put their case for the £1275 valuation forcefully. 

However, unknown to the council or anyone else, at the same time, Knight Frank and Savills produced a presentation for potential investors in the scheme which listed sales values on the site at £1641 per square foot. 

The second valuation was not disclosed to the planning authorities, it was only revealed after a presentation to investors was leaked to objectors to the scheme shortly before the public inquiry. 

After the second valuation had been revealed Mr John Rhodes, for Quod, who was giving evidence on this matter at the public inquiry in late November 2013, claimed that the difference could be attributed to timing. The lower valuation was based on current values, the investors presentation was looking at possible future values. 

This was an unlikely explanation. The investors presentation listed the values as 'sales prices'. Another slide demonstrated that at the time the presentation was produced in February 2013, the developers were planning to put the new flats on the market in July of that year.

Even if we take into account that the origional FVA was submitted in December 2012 with the planning application, then Quod seem to have been a 60% per year in sales values in London.  

Neither did the explanation seem to tally with other data from the local housing market. 

CBRE, another surveyor, had published a report which said that at prime locations in the South Bank values had already achieved an average of £2000 per square foot.  The Shell Centre is one of the most desirable locations in the area. 

In any event in April 2013, four months before Knight Frank and Savills had told investors that they were expecting to go to market at an average sales value of £1640 per square foot, Quod submitted an updated apraisal. This appears to contain a per square foot valuation of £1,205 per square foot.


##The real values

When the flats went on sale just a few months later the values which Quod, Knight Frank and Savills claimed were 'future possible values' ended up looking very conservative. 

The Shell Centre is being sold in phases. The first building put on the market in September 2015 was tehn called One York Square. It appears to have now changed its name to One Casson Square. According to the Shell Investor presentation, which was Knight Franks and Savills of 'future sales values' One Casson Square could achieve sales values of £1,416 psf on average.  

When I checked the website for the new Shell Centre development, 'Southbank Place', sales values of apartments at One Casson Square ranged between £1800 and £2000 per square foot.

But that was just the cheapest residential building at the back of the site. In April 2016 Southbank Place had it's Hong Kong launch! To celebrate, the developer put on the market Thirty Casson Square.

In the origional Shell Centre FVA thirty Casson Square is valued at £1,254 per square foot on average. The investors presentation, which Mr Rhodes claimed before a planning inspector was based on estimates of future values, put the building at £1,469 psf.

But the sales values being marketed in Hong Kong? The Shell Centre website lists the currently available apartments. In April 2016 apartment 204, on level 2, the bottom of the building was on sale for £900,000. That is £1,404 per square foot.

Apartment 2303 is on the 23rd floor. It went on the market for £2m or £1,940 per square foot. In fact the cheapest apartment for sale on the website, a tiny 394 sq foot studio apartment (yours for just £655,000) came in at £1,662 per square foot.

The only reasonable conclusion to draw from this evidence is that the investors presentation was not a prediction of future values. In fact, the investors presentation was a reflection of the expected sales prices in July 2013, when the Shell Centre was expected to go on the market. The conclusion that flows from this is that the figures inputted into the viability assessment were deliberately underestimated by Knight Frank, Savills and Quod, in order to produce an unrealistically pessamistic picture of the real financial viability of the scheme.
