# Shell

The Shell Centre is a £1.6bn redevelopment of the Shell International Petroleum Corporation's Headquarters on London's South Bank. The scheme will add more than 800 new homes to the site. Lambeth Council requires that on new developments 40% of housing is provided as affordable housing.

The development was approved by Lambeth Council in May 2013 and was called in by the Secretary of State later that year. A public inquiry was held in December of 2013, I challenged the decision in the High Court in 2014 and the development finally received permission in 2015.

Quod, a planning consultancy acting for the developer submitted a financial viability assessment \(FVA\) with the application which claimed that the development was so financially unviable that no affordable housing was possible on the site. Regardless the developer was prepared to offer 10% on site and 10% offsite as a sign of goodwill.

The estimates of sales values of the new apartments at the Shell Centre for the FVA were produced by Knight Frank and Savills, two leading firms of surveyors. This claimed that the new flats on the site would sell for an average of £1,275 per square foot.

The study was checked by BNP Paribas on behalf of the local council. This agreed with the general premise that the building was unviable but thought the valuation to be a bit low. The document also reveals despite the concerns of the council, Knight Frank and Savills insisted that their £1,275 valuation was accurate.

However, unknown to the council or anyone else, at the same time, Knight Frank and Savills produced a presentation for potential investors in the scheme which listed sales values on the site at £1,641 per square foot.[^2]

The second valuation was not disclosed to the planning authorities, it was only revealed after a presentation to investors was leaked to objectors to the scheme shortly before the public inquiry.

After the second valuation had been revealed Mr John Rhodes, for Quod, who was giving evidence on this matter at the public inquiry in early December 2013, claimed that the difference could be attributed to timing. The lower valuation was based on current values, the investors presentation was looking at possible future values.

The explanation didn't seem to tally with other data from the local housing market. CBRE, another surveyor, had published a report which said that at prime locations in the South Bank values had already achieved an average of £2,000 per square foot.  The Shell Centre is one of the most desirable locations in the area.

### Timings

So what were the timings of these valuations?

In April 2013, Quod had submitted an updated appraisal to the local authority.  That assessment took on board some of the criticisms of the BNP review of the original FVA, although it did not include higher sales prices for apartments as had been recommended by BNP. The only conclusion we can draw from this is that in April 2013 the surveyors were signalling to the planning authority that they were happy to stand by the £1,275 valuation.

The RICS guidance states that where there is a planning inquiry, then the date of the viability assessment should be taken as the date of the submission of written representations.

> There are occasions where the appraisals will require revisions. In certain circumstances, as a result of, for example, fundamental market changes or changes in density of the scheme, between submission of the viability assessment, application and consideration by the planning authority, it will be necessary to review and update the appraisal. This should, however, relate to changes in the market, or changes specific to the scheme, that would not have been known at the time of the original submission. **Where there is a planning appeal, the date should be agreed between the parties or taken as the date of the hearing\/written representations.** \[Emphasis added\]

For this reason, and in line with other guidance, developers will usually submit an updated viability assessment for the a planning inquiry.

In the Shell Centre case the hearings started in late November 2013. No further viability evidence was produced by the applicant's surveyors. The only evidence submitted was the BNP review of the viability assessment. BNP Paribas were not called to give evidence at the inquiry and had no knowledge of the existence of the investor presentation when writing their report.

Mr Rhodes of Quod gave evidence at the inquiry and signed a statement of truth confirming the applicant's case on the the viability position. As of November 2013 Quod and Mr Rhodes, who is a RICS registered surveyor were confirming the valuation of £1,275 psf.

The investors presentation was submitted to the inquiry the day after it started, and so Mr Rhodes was not aware that the investors valuation was going to be revealed when he submitted his evidence. When that presentation was revealed, Mr Rhodes continued to hold that the figures in it were not relevant to a current day analysis of the scheme.

What was the date of valuation in the investor's presentation? Unhelpfully, Mr Rhodes did not provide any date where he thought that value higher might be achieved, however, the clear inference was that in his view the valuation date was beyond November 2013. 

This simply did not tally with the investors presentation itself, which listed the values as 'sales prices'. Another slide demonstrated that at the time the presentation was produced in February 2013, the developers were planning to put the new flats on the market in July of that year. At the time, they did not know that the decision would be called in, and so the planning permission delayed. 

The higher valuation of the flats in the investor's presentation, far from being a future valuation which took account of future price inflation, was in fact a valuation for a date before the valuation submitted to the planning authorities.

Despite this, the inspector in the Shell Centre case fell for the ruse.

## The real values

When the flats went on sale just a few months after the scheme was finally granted permission in 2015 the values which Quod, Knight Frank and Savills claimed were 'future possible values' ended up looking very conservative.

The Shell Centre is being sold in phases. The first building was put on the market in September 2015 and called One York Square. It appears to have now changed its name to One Casson Square. According to the Shell Investor presentation, which  the applicants calimed were 'future sales values', One Casson Square could achieve sales values of £1,416 psf on average.

When I checked the website for the new Shell Centre development, 'Southbank Place', sales values of apartments at One Casson Square ranged between £1,800 and £2,000 per square foot.

In April 2016 Southbank Place had it's Hong Kong launch. To celebrate, the developer put on the market Thirty Casson Square.

In the original Shell Centre FVA thirty Casson Square is valued at £1,254 per square foot on average. The investors presentation, which Mr Rhodes claimed before a planning inspector was based on estimates of future values, put the building at £1,469 psf.

But the sales values being marketed in Hong Kong? In April 2016 apartment 204, on level 2, the bottom of the building was on sale for £900,000. That is £1,404 per square foot.

Apartment 2303 is on the 23rd floor. It went on the market for £2m or £1,940 per square foot. In fact the cheapest apartment for sale on the website, a tiny 394 sq foot studio apartment \(yours for just £655,000\) came in at £1,662 per square foot.

The only reasonable conclusion to draw from this evidence is that the investors presentation was not a prediction of future values. Instead \(as the presentation itself stated\) it set out the expected sales prices in July 2013, when the Shell Centre was expected to go on the market. The actual sales prices achieved were a consequence of price inflation in the London luxury hosuing market between 2013 and 2015. 

The conclusion that flows from this is that the figures inputted into the viability assessment were deliberately underestimated by Knight Frank, Savills and Quod, in order to produce an unrealistically pesamistic picture of the real financial viability of the scheme. To make matters worse the surveyors in this case were prepared to argue that case before a Secretary of State's planning inquiry and eventually see that case argued before a judge at the High Court.
