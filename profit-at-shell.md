#Profit at the Shell Centre
The developers at the Shell Centre used an Internal Rate of Return profit benchmark in their FVA. Their consultants, Quod, Knight Frank and Savills, made the claim that the required profit level on the scheme to achieve financial viability was an ungeared IRR of 20%. 

##Debt and equity
The word ungeared means assuming the developers borrow no money to invest in the scheme. It is highly significant. By its nature debt is a lower risk investment product. Investors will in normal circumstances always accept a lower return on money they lend to a project then if they were to directly invest in the project themselves by buying a stake in the project. 

This is because debt is a contract between the investor and the borrower. The borrower agrees to pay back the loan on fixed terms. If the borrower can't repay their debts, they become bankrupt. At that point a company can be liquidated, its assets sold off to pay back their obligations and lenders are are usually the first in the queue to be paid back. 

On the other hand, if an investor buys shares in a company the they have no set return on their investment, they are only paid a dividend if the profits of a company allow for it. If a company goes bankrupt, they can lose everything. For that reason investors in equity will always demand a higher rate of return than investors in debt. 

What all this means is that developers can boost the return to shareholders by introducing debt finance into the scheme. If a development makes a 20% return on average, and the developer can borrow at 10% then the equity holders will make significantly more than 20% depending on how much debt is used. That is because the 20% total return will be the average return to both shareholders and lenders. The level of debt in a project is called its gearing.  

So powerful is the effect of gearing on investment returns, that people in the finance industry I have spoken to believe that the investors at Shell could have easily doubled their return if they had chosen to use debt finance. In effect the developers at the Shell Centre were saying that unless they could return 40% a year to shareholders in their scheme they would not be able to attract investors. 

##The market
But was a 20% ungeared internal rate of return, let alone a 40% geared rate of return a reasonable thing to ask for? 

At the same time as telling the planning authorities that investors in the Shell Centre would demanded a minimum of a 20% ungeared IRR on their project, their agents, Knight Frank and Savills were also speaking to potential investors in the scheme. 

The powerpoint presentation they showed to investors contained a slide details the level of return being seen in several asset classes. London residential sees the highest rate of return at 12% with other asset classes it sees as comparables at being between 6-8%.

This corresponds to work done by other firms. Colliers produce a report on Global Investor Sentiment which is a survey of investors in the property industry, this found that investors are targeting IRRs of less than 10% in mature Western markets. Internal Rates of Return of 20% are seen for markets such as Asia and Eastern Europe which are seen as much higher risk.

##The development
So what reason did developers at the Shell centre give for such a high rate of return as a requirement for scheme viability?  The RICS guidance is clear that the judgement about the required profitability benchmark should take into account a range of factors. General market sentiment as well the specific risk profile of the development. 

However, the financial viability consultants did not produce any of this evidence. Their entire analysis of why such a high profitability benchmark was chosen was based on the argument that developers in other councils had agreed a 20% IRR on other development proposals with other developers. Specfically they pointed to the Battersea Power Station Development, and the redevelopment of Earls Court. 

In those cases, the developers may well have got away with too much as well, but their developments were also a very different proposition. Battersea power station is a vast development three times the size of the Shell Centre development. It requires the building of a new tube line to it and for the developers to dismantle and rebuild a grade two listed powerstation on the site. Earls Court is a vast development which will take 20 years to complete. 

The Shell Centre on the other hand is right in central London, next to Waterloo station. It has views over the Houses of Parliament. There is a strong commitment to the scheme from the landowner, Shell, who have pre-let a substantial part of the office space. The rest of the office space was sold to the investment firm Almacantar in a deal arranged before planning permission was secured, but executed after it was granted. The fact that the developer had sold all of the office space on the site before a shovel was put in the ground substantially decreased the risk of the site.

However, no analysis of the specific risks of the scheme appears to have been done when setting the profitability benchmark.
