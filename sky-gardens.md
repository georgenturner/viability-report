# Vauxhall Sky Gardens

Frasers property was granted planning permission to build a quite specularly ugly tower in Vauxhall in 2008. The tower, called Vauxhall Sky Gardens is a residential and office tower. A white tube, with green glass and a roof garden.

The original planning permission came with an agreement that the developer would provide 40% affordable housing onsite. The developers were expecting a government grant to subsidise the building of affordable housing.

For applications where grant was available Lambeth council's policy was that 50% of the development should be affordable.

In 2010 the developer successfully lobbied the council to reduce the affordable housing requirement to 31% and to allow them to build higher and get rid of some of the commercial space, increasing the amount of market housing on the site.

In 2013 they returned to the council again, requesting that the affordable housing requirement be got rid of altogether. Their claim was that there proposals were so desperately unprofitable that this was the only way that the scheme would be viable. This time the council only partially accepted their argument and reduced the requirement to 17%.

At the time, it was transparently obvious that the developer was aggressively gaming the system. However, after their confidential viability assessment became public though a mistake by Lambeth Council, it became clear that surveyors had deliberately undervalued properties to allow Fraser's to get away with building less affordable housing and making more profit.

## The Viability of Vauxhall Sky Gardens

The Vauxhall Sky Gardens site is a former data storage facility. Data storage sites are not worth a huge amount of money, particularly when they have been sitting derelict for several years. Even if they are in Central London. The developers of Vauxhall Sky Gardens put in their financial viability appraisal that the site would be worth £850,000 if it was sold in its former use.

According to documents submitted by the developers to the council, Vauxhall Sky Gardens is not a viable development. In the appraisal submitted to Lambeth Council in 2013, once the costs and the developer’s cut has been deducted from the sales values at VSG the money left over to pay the landowner \(the residual land value\) is £333,000. The appraisal was done on the basis of no affordable housing being provided and was used to justify the argument that the developer couldn’t afford to build any.

## Transparently absurd

On the face of it, the proposition being put to Lambeth Council by the developer was absurd. They were being asked to believe that after building a new tower of luxury apartments moments away from Vauxhall Station and the river, the developer will only be left with little more than £300,000 and will have to dig into their profits to make up another few hundred thousand for the landowner.

The land registry entry for the site where VSG is proposed tells us that Frasers bought the site in 2007 for £6,470,000 + VAT. Of course, 2008 was just before the crash. However, the crash appears not to have affected Vauxhall Sky Gardens. In 2012 there were rumours that Frasers were in talks to sell the site to another developer for £20m. In the end the sale appears not to have gone ahead, but Frasers have moved forward with the development and it is now close to completion.

So the developer in both 2010 and 2013 told the Council that they expect that the sales values minus cost will only generate a few hundred thousand pounds to pay the landonwer for the land – but when they bought the site in 2007 they expected the same calculation to allow them to pay the landowner £6.5 million + VAT and in 2012 that expectation had risen to at least £20m.

## Surveyors and alchemy

So why does a developer pay £6.5m for a piece of land on which it intends to build a building that will leave it a mere £330,000 in cash to cover the cost of that land?

In the 2013 viability assessment presented to Lambeth Council it is said that Savills provided a pricing schedule of the proposed flats at Vauxhall Sky Gardens for the viability assessment. This was for working out the revenues that the scheme would generate from selling apartments. The viability assessment is dated January 2013. It says that flats in the tower will achieve an average sales value of £711 per square foot.

However, later that year Lambeth Council received another viability assessment for the neighbouring site, 12-20 Wyvil Road. That assessment uses a schedule of sales prices for new apartments on the Vauxhall Sky Gardens site as a comparable for their estimates of sales values on their own site. Again the schedule is produced by Savills, who appear to have been the agent for VSG. The date of this pricing schedule is December 2013. This gives average sales values of apartments in the tower of between £1,416 and £1,602. More than double the values in VSG viability assessment.

## VSG Savills Pricing

The later sales schdule did not detail all of the apartments on sale, and it is the case that most of these values come from the upper floors of the building, but even the apartments on lower floors show sales values significantly above the average given in the Vauxhall Sky Gardens viability assessment. One flat on floor 14 \(private residential flats only start on floor 12 as there is office space and affordable housing below\) is listed as having a sales value of £1,183 per square foot. The viability assessment for Vauxhall Sky Gardens suggested that these flats would come in at around £580-£600 per square foot.

How much difference does this really make? A ball park calculation based on the published net internal area of the market housing of 126,799 sq ft, shows that the differnce between the two pricing schedules would produce an additional £100m of revenues for the developer.

Although in this case there was a real timing difference in the valuations, the London housing market is not so absurd as to produce a doubling of prices within a year.
